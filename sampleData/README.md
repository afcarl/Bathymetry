# Features
        names = ['long','lat','depth','sigma_h','sigma_d','source_id','pred_depth','dens20', 'dens60','gravity','age','rate','sed thick', 'roughness']

This is the feature names array in the python script that I'm running.

## This section describes the columns in sample.cm in the respective order the columns are listed in `sample.cm`.
## long

Pretty much as the name suggests, it is the longitude of the data collected.

## lat

Latitude of where the data was collected.

## depth

This is the measured depth.

## sigma_h

Like in statistics, this sigma stands for the horizontal standard deviation.

## sigma_d

A placeholder, feature. We use this column to store the bad data flag.

## source_id

This is the assigned id for the ship's cruise, this will probably make a good key for the sql db..

## pred_depth

This is the predicted depth using an algorithm. The seafloor depth based on a combination of depth predictions from gravity and the measured depth from a previous iteration from the model.

**Yoav:** I think it would make sense to have features that characterize the known depth in a region around the current point. Similarly it would be good to have features that characterize measurements before/after the current measurement point.

## Everything below is added by data extracted from various grd files.
## dens20/dens60

The data density filtered over 10 and 30km half wavelengths.

## gravity

The vertical gravity gradient based on satellite altimetry. Show small scale structures on the seafloor.

![map of gravity](static/images/gravity.png?raw=true "Map of gravity")

## age

This is the age of the seafloor.

![map of age](static/images/agev2.png?raw=true "Map of seafloor age (roygbiv scale inverted")

## rate

Spreading rate based on the age grid above.

![map of rate](static/images/rate.png?raw=true "Map of rate")

## sed thickness

This is the floor's sediment thickness. Areas of thick sediment have a flat seafloor.

![map of sed thickness](static/images/sed.png?raw=true "Map of sediment thickness")

## roughness

This is a measure of how rough the seafloor is. High pass filtered topography at 80km half wavelength squared and low pass filtered at 80km square rooted.
